## UdaciCards

The app allows you to add questions and answers - card to each topic - deck. For each correct answer you will earn 10 points. You will be deducted 5 points for an incorrect answer. Version 2 of the app once a total point of each deck reaches a preset scores, the card will be deleted. If you answer a question incorrect two times, it will show up in a 'reminder list'. Enjoy!
